# Algorithmic-Trading-Series-On-MetaTrader-5-with-Python

This repository contains an algorithmic trading project using Python in the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) platform. It showcases the development and execution of automated trading strategies based on various indicators, signals, and conditions.

## Description

Algorithmic trading, also known as automated trading or black-box trading, refers to the use of computer programs to execute trades based on pre-defined rules and strategies. In this project, we leverage the power of Python and the MetaTrader 5 platform to implement and execute algorithmic trading strategies.

The main goals of this project are:
- To demonstrate the integration of Python with MetaTrader 5 for algorithmic trading.
- To provide an example of a basic algorithmic trading strategy using technical indicators.
- To offer a starting point for traders and developers interested in exploring algorithmic trading with Python and MetaTrader 5.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Install MetaTrader 5: Download and install the MetaTrader 5 platform from the official MetaQuotes website (https://www.metatrader5.com/en/download).

2. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithmic-trading-mt5-python.git


3. Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Customize the Trading Strategy: Open the Python script(s) in the repository and modify the trading strategy, indicators, and trade management logic according to your requirements. You can find them in the `src/` directory.

5. Run the Project: Execute the main Python script to run the algorithmic trading strategy. Monitor the output and the trading operations performed by the strategy in the MetaTrader 5 platform.
